    "# Simple web applications with Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to make a basic web application. Why are we making a web application in a data journalism class? That's a good question! Our reasons are two-fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We've done a lot of work in this class *extracting* information from web pages and web APIs. *Making* a web application is a good way to further develop and hone your instincts about how web applications are put together—hopefully making it easier for you to reason about web applications and extract information from them.\n",
    "2. Understanding how web applications are developed, and having some experience in developing them, is a useful professional skill. Just a little bit of knowledge will help you participate in conversations about how these services should be designed and implemented, and maybe undertake some of those projects on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said all this, I want to state right off the bat that the applications we'll develop in this tutorial work fine, but might not work *at scale*. The difficulty with web applications is that they have to work not just for one person at one time, but for potentially *thousands* of people over the course of years. That means that there are a whole category of issues that come into play when developing web applications that we haven't bothered to look at in this class, and won't be able to address in full during this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Web applications\n",
    "\n",
    "A web application is a computer program running on a server somewhere that responds to requests from web browsers (and other kinds of web clients, as we'll see).\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the purpose of a web application is to provide an easily-accessible public-facing interface for some kind of data. The simplest kind of \"web application\" is a \"server\" that simply responds to requests for particular files on a computer—and there was a period in the history of the web in which this was by far the most dominant form of web application, and the idea of \"web development\" consisted mostly of writing HTML files and uploading them to such a server. (If you've ever done web programming with PHP or the Apache web server, then you've experienced this kind of web development.) In a contemporary context, most web applications are programs that respond in sophisticated ways to browser requests by dynamically composing responses from various sources, such as databases and real-time data feeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, what is meant by \"requests\" and \"responses\"? To answer that, let's back up a bit and answer the question...\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the web works\n",
    "\n",
    "Any computer on the Internet is capable of opening a network connection to\n",
    "another. For our purposes, you can think of these network connections as kind\n",
    "of like UNIX standard input and standard output: one computer (the \"client\")\n",
    "opens a connection to another computer (the \"server\"). The client sends bytes\n",
    "to the server, and the server responds with bytes of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single \"server\" can have multiple programs running on it that respond to\n",
    "network connections. Such programs distinguish themselves from one another by\n",
    "listening to network connections on different \"ports.\" So for example, the\n",
    "program on a server that responds to network connections related to sending\n",
    "e-mail might listen for connections on port 25, while the program that responds\n",
    "to connections related to database services might listen on port 27017. In this\n",
    "chapter, we'll write programs that listen for network connections, and we'll\n",
    "need to select a port for the programs to listen to. We'll need to select a port\n",
    "that isn't already in use by another program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some port numbers are associated by convention with particular services.\n",
    "Notably, port 80 is considered the \"default\" port for communicating with server\n",
    "programs that serve web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A language in common\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained above, the Internet allows a client computer to send bytes to a\n",
    "server computer, and get bytes in return. But two programs can't meaningfully\n",
    "communicate with one another unless they speak a common language---unless they\n",
    "have a set of rules in common that dictate what the data sent between them\n",
    "should look like and what that data \"means.\" Over the history of the Internet,\n",
    "industrious individuals have taken it upon themselves to invent such languages.\n",
    "The official word for these languages is \"protocol.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [hundreds of protocols in use on the\n",
    "Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Application_layer_protocols).\n",
    "As you're reading this, your computer is likely using dozens of them\n",
    "simultaneously to communicate with other computers on the Internet (or between\n",
    "programs on your own computer).  There's a protocol for [sending\n",
    "mail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol), a protocol\n",
    "for [looking up domain names](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System),\n",
    "a protocol for [peer-to-peer file\n",
    "sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HyperText Transfer Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol used by the web---i.e., the protocol that web browsers use to talk\n",
    "to web servers---is called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). In many ways,\n",
    "HTTP is a very straightforward protocol---so straightforward that it's possible\n",
    "for us to write requests by hand, essentially doing the work on our own that\n",
    "we would normally delegate to a web browser. To do this, we're going to use\n",
    "a utility called *netcat* (typed `nc`). Netcat allows us to connect to arbitrary\n",
    "ports on arbitrary servers and type in whatever text we want. Here's how to\n",
    "use netcat to speak HTTP to the server where the schedule for Reading and\n",
    "Writing Electronic Text resides:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t$ nc rwet.decontextualize.com 80\n",
    "\tGET /schedule.html HTTP/1.1\n",
    "    Host: rwet.decontextualize.com\n",
    "\n",
    "What you just typed in is known as the HTTP *request*. It's the information\n",
    "that the client sends to the server, prompting the server to respond. After you\n",
    "type the line beginning with `Host:`, hit enter twice, and you should see some\n",
    "output that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n",
    "\tServer: nginx\n",
    "\tDate: Mon, 20 Apr 2015 05:14:43 GMT\n",
    "\tContent-Type: text/html\n",
    "\tContent-Length: 15433\n",
    "\tConnection: keep-alive\n",

    "\t[...more html follows...]\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the HTTP *response*. This is what the server sends to the client in response to its request. Let's talk a bit about the specific structure of both\n",
    "response and request.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "An HTTP request consists of three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first line, which contains the method, path and HTTP version;\n",
    "* a series of *headers*, which are key/value pairs separated by colons; and\n",
    "* optionally, a request *body*.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll point out these parts using the request we just made with netcat.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tGET /schedule.html HTTP/1.1\n",
    "    Host: rwet.decontextualize.com\n",
    "\n",
    "In this request, `GET` is the method; `/schedule.html` is the path, and\n",
    "`HTTP/1.1` is the HTTP version. There's only one header in this request:\n",
    "`Host`. You have to include a `Host` header for every HTTP/1.1 request, and the\n",
    "header must be set to the domain name of the server that you're sending the\n",
    "request to.  This request, translated into English, means essentially this:\n",
    "\"Hey, web server! I want to get the document at the path `/schedule.html` on\n",
    "your server. I'm speaking HTTP/1.1 (and not a newer or older version of the\n",
    "protocol). In case you didn't know, the host that I'm making this request to is\n",
    "`rwet.decontextualize.com`.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This request has no *body*. A body is sent with a request only when the request is doing something like submitting data from a form, or uploading a file. In fact, you can't send a body with a `GET` request at all; bodies are only supported for `POST` and `PUT` requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, what are all of these \"methods\"? What do they mean? Why is there more\n",
    "than one? That's a good question! In HTTP, the method is a verb that specifies\n",
    "what the client wants the server to do with the document named in the path.\n",
    "There is a closed set of valid HTTP verbs, meaning you can't just make new ones\n",
    "up on the fly. How exactly the server interprets these verbs is specific to\n",
    "each web application, but in general the verbs have the following uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GET`: Client wants the server to return the content of the resource named in the path.\n",
    "* `PUT`: Client wants to modify the contents of the resource named in the path, or create a new resource with the given path.\n",
    "* `POST`: Client wants to add to or modify the resource.\n",
    "* `DELETE`: Client wants to remove the resource.\n",
    "* `HEAD`: Client wants to check to see whether or not the resource exists, and maybe get metadata about the resource, without necessarily fetching the contents of the resource.\n",
    "* `OPTIONS`: Client wants to know which of the above methods are supported for the given resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the meanings of these verbs overlap in strange ways (e.g., it's\n",
    "not clear what the difference between `POST` and `PUT` is, since both are used\n",
    "to add and modify resources). Every web service uses these verbs slightly\n",
    "differently, and when you implement a web service, you need to make decisions\n",
    "about what the verbs \"mean.\" It's best to stick to convention, but there's\n",
    "nothing stopping you from making your application accept `GET` requests that\n",
    "delete resources, or `POST` requests that return resources instead of modifying\n",
    "them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most web applications make use only of the verbs `GET` and `POST`. This is\n",
    "because most web browsers only support those two methods (though with the\n",
    "advent of HTML5, the situation is changing). Even today, if you're developing a\n",
    "web application---especially one that's designed for browsers, and not\n",
    "necessarily for automated agents---you're safe making your service only support\n",
    "`GET` and `POST`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "The response we received from the web server in the netcat example above looked like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n",
    "\tServer: nginx\n",
    "\tDate: Mon, 20 Apr 2015 05:14:43 GMT\n",
    "\tContent-Type: text/html\n",
    "\tContent-Length: 15433\n",
    "\tConnection: keep-alive\n",
    "\tVary: Accept-Encoding\n",
    "\tLast-Modified: Wed, 15 Apr 2015 19:13:26 GMT\n",
    "\tETag: \"188600cb-3c49-513c8243e4180\"\n",
    "\tAccept-Ranges: bytes\n",
    "\n",
    "\t<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\"\n",
    "\t\t\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\">\n",
    "\t<html>\n",
    "\t[...more html follows...]\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the *response*. The response consists of the status line, a series of\n",
    "one or more headers, and then the body of the response. The status line has the\n",
    "HTTP version and a number that indicates the status of the request---this is\n",
    "the so-called HTTP \"status code.\" `200` means \"okay, here's your data\"; `404`\n",
    "means \"I couldn't find the resource you wanted.\" There are dozens of other\n",
    "codes with various meanings and conventional uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The headers tell us information about the response, such as how many bytes are in it (the `Content-Length` header), what kind of document it is (the `Content-Type` header), and when the document was last modified (the `Last-Modified` header). Some of the headers are required; some are optional. The client needs to know\n",
    "this information so that it can properly download the data and display it to\n",
    "the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the headers, we see the response body. The response body is simply the\n",
    "data contained in the resource that the client requested. On the web, response\n",
    "bodies are usually HTML documents, but they can also be other things, like\n",
    "images, PDFs, MP3s, etc. Web APIs generally return JSON documents, not HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Web frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already discussed in this class [how to make web\n",
    "requests](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ledeprogram/courses/blob/master/databases/02%20Dictionaries%20and%20Web%20APIs.ipynb).\n",
    "You could just type in all your web requests by hand, but it's easier to have\n",
    "an application (like a web browser, or `curl`) or a library (like `urllib`) do\n",
    "it for you. These tools abstract away all the work of formatting the request\n",
    "correctly, including the right headers, etc. so you can just get your work\n",
    "done.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the same situation with writing a web *server*---a program that receives\n",
    "web requests and then respond to them. You could write a program that listens\n",
    "on the network for incoming connections, parses HTTP requests according\n",
    "to the HTTP standard, then sends responses in the correct format. But that would\n",
    "be a hassle! It turns out that enterprising programmers have already done that\n",
    "work for us---the work of making a program that listens for HTTP requests and responds to them. That work takes the form of a *web framework*---a kind of \"skeleton\" for a web server that has all the difficult stuff already taken care of.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework gives you access to everything in the HTTP request in a clean,\n",
    "abstrated way: the path of the request, the HTTP method, the body of the\n",
    "request, any headers, and the query string. Your job is to write rules and code\n",
    "that specify what should happen when requests are received. What should the\n",
    "response code be? What should the response body look like? And so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web frameworks also commonly supply functionality to make writing web\n",
    "applications easier, such as HTML template rendering and database connection\n",
    "abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of \"frameworks\" for Python. They all have benefits and\n",
    "drawbacks. Here are a few well-known frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/): a full-featured \"full stack\" web framework. Robust but complex.\n",
    "* [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/): a barebones web framework that uses asynchronous I/O for extreme scalability.\n",
    "* [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html): a fast and simple \"microframework\" with no external dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're going to use a framework called [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). I\n",
    "chose Flask because it's easy to get started with, but has a clear path for\n",
    "making more advanced web applications when you're ready to take off the\n",
    "training wheels. There's also an [active developer community producing helpful\n",
    "Flask extensions](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/) and [extensive,\n",
    "beginner-friendly documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we're going to use Flask to take the text manipulation and text\n",
    "generation projects that we've made so far and turn them into simple web\n",
    "applications. In the process, we're just going to scratch the surface of\n",
    "what's possible with Flask, but hopefully it'll be enough to whet your\n",
    "appetite and help you understand the basic concepts.\n",
    "\n",

In the string-reversing application above, we used the `.args` attribute of the `request` object to read parameters passed in on the query string. In this case, because the request was submitted with `POST` using a form, we use the `.form` attribute of the `request` object. The `.form` attribute also behaves like a dictionary. The value for each key in the dictionary corresponds to whatever the user put into the HTML form widget with the corresponding name. Let's look at the `<form>` tag in `simplify_home.html` again:\n",

In this way, you can think of the `<form>` tag as a weird kind of hyperlink. The `<form>` tag has two important attributes: `action`, whose value specifies what URL the web request should be sent to, and `method`, which specifies which HTTP method to use. (This is almost always `POST` or `GET`.) Inside the `<form>` tag, you can use various HTML elements, including `<textarea>` and `<input>`, to add widgets to the form, like free-form text inputs, sliders, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc. ([Here's the full list of native widgets and their functionality.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/The_native_form_widgets)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The special `<input type=\"submit\">` widget creates a button; when you click the button, the web browser makes the request as specified by the form and the values that the user has filled in. You can actually use Chrome Developer Tools to see what this request looks like, as the browser sent it. Open Developer Tools, select the \"Network\" tab and reload the page after submitting the form, then select the only item in the left-hand panel. You'll see something that looks like this:\n",

    "This shows exactly the data that the browser sent to our web application! Most of this data is filled in automatically by the browser for *every* request. But the \"Request Header\" section shows that the method (`POST`) and path (`/transformed`) are as we supplied them in the form; the \"Form Data\" (or request body) section shows the data from the form, as it was included in the request. (Forms sent via `POST` by default use a special form of encoding called [application/x-www-form-urlencoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#The_application.2Fx-www-form-urlencoded_type).)\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in our program, Flask runs the `transformed()` function in response to this request. Flask automatically parses the form data in the request for us, making it available in the `request.form` dictionary (as discussed above). We use the value for the `text` key to perform some creative text transformation, and then render it in the template. Voila, an interactive web application!\n",

We're going to make a simple web application that allows users to view data from the MONDIAL database as HTML.
