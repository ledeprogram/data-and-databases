    "# Getting data from HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML stands for \"hypertext markup language.\" Most of the documents you see when you're browsing the web are written in this format.  Our goal today is to discuss and put into practice basic methods for extracting data from documents written in HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most browsers, there's a \"View Source\" option that allows you to see the HTML source code for any page you're looking at. For example, in Chrome, you can CTRL-click anywhere on the page, or go to `View > Developer > View Source`:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/nytimes-view-source.png\"><img src=\"http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/nytimes-view-source.png\" alt=\"nytimes-view-source\"/></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see something that looks like this, a mish-mash of angle brackets and quotes and slashes and text. This is HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/nytimes-source.png\"><img src=\"http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/nytimes-source.png\" alt=\"nytimes-source\"/></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What HTML looks like\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML consists of a series of *tags*. Tags have a *name*, a series of key/value pairs called *attributes*, and some textual *content*. Attributes are optional. Here's a simple example, using the HTML `<p>` tag (`p` means \"paragraph\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p>Mother said there'd be days like these.</p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "This example has just one tag in it: a `<p>` tag. The source code for a tag has two parts, its opening tag (`<p>`) and its closing tag (`</p>`). In between the opening and closing tag, you see the tag's contents (in this case, the text `Mother said there'd be days like these.`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another example, using the HTML `<div>` tag:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <div class=\"header\" style=\"background: blue;\">Mammoth Falls</div>\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this example, the tag's name is `div`. The tag has two attributes: `class`, with value `header`, and `style`, with value `background: blue;`. The contents of this tag is `Mammoth Falls`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tags can contain other tags, in a hierarchical relationship. For example, here's some HTML to make a bulletted list:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "      <li>Item one</li>\n",
    "      <li>Item two</li>\n",
    "      <li>Item three</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<ul>` tag (`ul` stands for \"unordered list\") in this example has three other `<li>` tags inside of it (`li` stands for \"list item\"). The `<ul>` tag is said to be the \"parent\" of the `<li>` tags, and the `<li>` tags are the \"children\" of the `<ul>` tag. All tags grouped under a particular parent tag are called \"siblings.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML's shortcomings\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML documents are intended to add \"markup\" to text to add information that allows browsers to display the text in different ways---e.g., HTML markup might tell the browser to make the font of the text a particular size, or to position it in a particular place on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the primary purpose of HTML is to change the appearance of text, HTML markup usually does *not* tell us anything useful about what the text means, or what kind of data it contains. When you look at a web page in the browser, it might appear to contain a list of newspaper articles, or a table with birth rates, or a series of names with associated biographies, or whatever. But that's information that we get, as humans, from reading the page. There's (usually) no easy way to extract this information with a computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML is also notoriously messy---web browsers are very forgiving of syntax errors and other irregularities in HTML (like mismatched or unclosed tags). (This is in contrast to data formats like JSON, where even small errors will fail to be parsed.) For this reason, we need special libraries to parse HTML into data structures that our Python programs can use, libraries that can make a \"good guess\" about what the structure of an HTML document is, even when that structure is written incorrectly or inconsistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is a Python library that parses HTML (even if it's poorly formatted) and allows us to extract and manipulate its contents. We'll be using this library in the examples that follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that there are only sketchy rules for what HTML elements \"mean\"---semantic information you figure out for one web page might not apply to the next. Values for `class` attributes especially are meaningful only in the context of a single page.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: There's an effort to add semantic information to HTML markup called [HTML Microformats](http://microformats.org/). If sites added microformats to their markup, you'd be able to write code that could more reliably extract information from web pages, because there would be a common language for what tags with particular classes and attributes mean. Alas, microformats remain unpopular, and until the anarcho-collectivists win a greater mindshare, we can count only on our own individual readings of individual HTML documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspecting HTML's anatomy with Developer Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "I've crafted a very simple example of HTML for us to work with. It concerns kittens. [Here's the rendered version](http://static.decontextualize.com/kittens.html), and [here's the HTML source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ledeprogram/courses/master/databases/data/kittens.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to use Developer Tools in Chrome to take a look at how `kittens.html` is organized. Click on the \"rendered version\" link above. In Chrome, ctrl-click (or right click) anywhere on the page and select \"Inspect Element.\" This will open Chrome's Developer Tools. Your screen should look (something) like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/kittens-dev-tools.png\"><img src=\"http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/kittens-dev-tools.png\" alt=\"kittens-dev-tools\"/></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the upper panel, you see the web page you're inspecting. In the lower panel, you see a version of the HTML source code, with little arrows next to some of the lines. (The little arrows allow you to collapse parts of the HTML source that are hierarchically related.) As you move your mouse over the elements in the top panel, different parts of the source code will be highlighted. Chrome is showing you which parts of the source code are causing which parts of the page to show up. Pretty spiffy!\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship also works in reverse: you can move your mouse over some part of the source code in the lower panel, which will highlight in the top panel what that source code corresponds to on the page. We'll be using this later to visually identify the parts of the page that are interesting to us, so we can write code that extracts the contents of those parts automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Characterizing the structure of kittens\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the source code of kittens.html looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t<!doctype html>\n",
    "\t<html>\n",
    "\t  <head>\n",
    "\t    <title>Kittens!</title>\n",
    "\t  </head>\n",
    "\t  <body>\n",
    "\t    <h1>Kittens and the TV Shows They Love</h1>\n",
    "\t    <div class=\"kitten\">\n",
    "\t      <h2>Fluffy</h2>\n",
    "\t      <div><img src=\"http://placekitten.com/100/100\"></div>\n",
    "\t      <ul class=\"tvshows\">\n",
    "\t        <li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106145/\">Deep Space Nine</a></li>\n",
    "\t        <li><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088576/\">Mr. Belvedere</a></li>\n",
    "\t      </ul>\n",
    "\t      Last check-up: <span class=\"lastcheckup\">2014-01-17</span>\n",
    "\t    </div>\n",
    "\t    <div class=\"kitten\">\n",
    "\t      <h2>Monsieur Whiskeurs</h2>\n",
    "\t      <div><img src=\"http://placekitten.com/150/100\"></div>\n",

    "\t    </div>\n",
    "\t  </body>\n",
    "\t</html>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is pretty well organized HTML, but if you don't know how to read HTML, it will still look like a big jumble. Here's how I would characterize the structure of this HTML, reading in my own idea of what the meaning of the elements are.\n",

    "* We have two \"kittens,\" both of which are contained in `<div>` tags with class `kitten`.\n",
    "* Each \"kitten\" `<div>` has an `<h2>` tag with that kitten's name.\n",
    "* There's an image for each kitten, specified with an `<img>` tag.\n",
    "* Each kitten has a list (a `<ul>` with class `tvshows`) of television shows, contained within `<li>` tags.\n",
    "* Those list items themselves have links (`<a>` tags) with an `href` attribute that contains a link to an IMDB entry for that show.\n",
    "\n",
    "> BONUS QUIZ: What's the parent tag of `<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088576/\">Mr. Belvedere</a>`? Both `<div class=\"kitten\">` tags share a parent tag---what is it? What attributes are present on both `<img>` tags?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scraping kittens with Beautiful Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "We've examined `kittens.html` a bit now. What we'd like to do is write some code that is going to extract information from the HTML, like \"what is the last checkup date for each of these kittens?\" or \"what are Monsieur Whiskeur's favorite TV shows?\" To do so, we need to *parse* the HTML, and create a representation of it in our program that we can manipulate with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, HTML is hard to parse by hand. (Don't even try it. In particular, [don't parse HTML with regular expressions](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454).)\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a Python library that will parse the HTML for us, and give us some Python objects that we can call methods on to poke at the data contained therein. So instead of working with strings and bytes, we can work with \n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is available on PyPI, which means you can install it with `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip3 install beautifulsoup4\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup only parses HTML. It's left to us to actually *get* the HTML from somewhere. Because we're doing web scraping, most likely we'll want to download the HTML directly from the web site that hosts it. For that, we'll use the `urlopen` function in the built-in Python library `urllib.request`:"
