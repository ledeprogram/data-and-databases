    "This homework presents a sophisticated scenario in which you must design a SQL schema, insert data into it, and issue queries against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "In the year 20XX, I have won the lottery and decided to leave my programming days behind me in order to pursue my true calling as a [cat cafe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_caf%C3%A9) tycoon. [This webpage](http://static.decontextualize.com/cats.html) lists the locations of my cat cafes and all the cats that are currently in residence at these cafes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm interested in doing more detailed analysis of my cat cafe holdings and the cats that are currently being cared for by my cafes. For this reason, I've hired *you* to convert this HTML page into a workable SQL database. (Why don't I just do it myself? Because I am far too busy hanging out with adorable cats in all of my beautiful, beautiful cat cafes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, I want to know the answers to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What's the name of the youngest cat at any location?\n",
    "* In which zip codes can I find a lilac-colored tabby?\n",
    "* What's the average weight of cats currently residing at any location (grouped by location)?\n",
    "* Which location has the most cats with tortoiseshell coats?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because I'm not paying you very much, and because I am a merciful person who has considerable experience in these matters, I've decided to *write the queries for you*. (See below.) Your job is just to scrape the data from the web page, create the appropriate tables in PostgreSQL, and insert the data into those tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you continue, scroll down to \"The Queries\" below to examine the queries as I wrote them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem set #1: Scraping the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first goal is to create two data structures, both lists of dictionaries: one for the list of locations and one for the list of cats. You'll get these from scraping two `<table>` tags in the HTML: the first table has a class of `cafe-list`, the second has a class of `cat-list`.\n",
